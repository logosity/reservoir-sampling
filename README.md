# Reservoir Sampling Distribution Test

A simple demonstration that reservoir sampling produces a uniform distribution. Born of a convo about:
[this perl cookbook entry](https://csg.sph.umich.edu/chen/Perl/cookbook/ch08_07.htm)

## AI Note:
The python code and most of this readme was generated by claude/vibed. For code like this,
that is essentially an example for a conversation, I feel this is a good use of such tools, but caveat emptor!

## What it does

- `reservoir.pl` - Implements reservoir sampling in Perl
- `reservoir.py` - Implements reservoir sampling in Python
- `analyze.py` - Plots the distribution and applies a chi-square test
- `test.txt` - Test input (lines 1-100)

Both implementations take a filename and iteration count as parameters.

## Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Install dependencies
venv/bin/pip install pandas matplotlib scipy

# optional to show plots using `plt.show()`
venv/bin/pip install pyqt5
```

## Run

```bash
# Run Python version (generate samples + analyze)
just py

# Run Perl version (generate samples + analyze)
just pl
```

The script outputs statistics and saves `distribution.png` showing the results.
